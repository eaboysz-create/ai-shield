Personal AI Shield – an open concept for a “digital seatbelt” that protects people from scams, manipulation and deepfakes. This repo documents the vision, use cases and principles for human-first AI tools that work on the user’s side, not against them.
# AI Shield – a personal “seatbelt” in the age of AI

**Idea:** a personal AI layer that stands between a human and the digital world – and works only on their side.  
Not AI for corporations, not AI for ads, but a basic safety layer for ordinary people.

---

## Problem

AI is already being used for:

- aggressive marketing and emotional manipulation,
- scam calls and phishing,
- large-scale data collection and monetisation,
- tracking, scoring and control.

An ordinary person has **NO protection**.

They can be tricked by:

- a “bank” call with a perfect script,
- an SMS pretending to be from government services,
- a fake “security department”,
- a deepfaked voice or face of someone they trust.

The systems around us are getting smarter.  
The individual human is not getting a matching shield.

---

## Concept

**AI Shield** is a personal agent that:

- analyses incoming calls, messages and links;
- flags risks and manipulation patterns;
- helps the human make a decision – instead of nudging them into one.

The goal is to put AI **on the human’s side**, not against them.

---

## Core capabilities (MVP)

- Scam call detection and blocking  
- SMS / messenger / phishing link detection  
- A **digital identity passport** (voice + face) to help detect deepfakes  
- Manipulation detection (fear, urgency, guilt, “only now”)  
- Transparent explanations of why something is considered risky

---

## Principles

1. **Human-first**  
   AI Shield always acts in the interest of the user, not the company or platform.

2. **Local by default**  
   As much processing as possible should run on the user’s device.

3. **Transparent decisions**  
   The system explains why it flags a call/message/link as risky.

4. **No hidden monetisation of data**  
   Protection cannot be built on selling or quietly exploiting user data.

5. **Open concept**  
   The AI Shield idea is not proprietary. Anyone can implement it as long as these principles are respected.

---

## Status

This repository is a **manifesto and conceptual starting point**.

Goals:

- inspire real-world implementations (client apps, OS-level agents, telco/bank integrations);  
- bring the “AI Shield” perspective into discussions on AI safety for ordinary users;  
- provide a simple, human-centric framing: AI should protect people from scams and manipulation, not amplify them.

## Key statement

> **AI must work on the side of humanity, not against it.**  
> If this power is already in the wrong hands, humans urgently need their own “seatbelt” – a personal AI Shield.
